# 3.6 Maps and Layers
In MicroCity, **Shapes** and **Grids** can be showed in **Maps**. Each map may contains multiple layers and each layer is corresponding to a **Shapes** or a **Grid**.
## Opening, Creating, Saving, Printing and Closing Maps
Because **Maps** are based on **Shapes** and **Grids**, they can not be saved or opened independently, but can be saved or opened along with a **MicroCity Project** (\*.mprj). Creating a **Map** is by double clicking a **Shapes** or **Grid** from the **Data** Tab of the **Workspace** Panel. A **Map** window contains four coordinate bars which can be used to locate objects (see below). A **Map** can also be printed or closed from the context menu of the **Maps** Tab of the **Workspace** Panel.

## Adding, Moving, Hiding and Closing Layers in a Map
A **Map** can have multiple **Layers**, each of them represents a data item. One can add a **Layer** to a **Map** by double clicking a **Shapes** or a **Grid** from the **Data** Tab. A lower **layer** can be obscured by upper layers. One can move a layer by dragging, hide a layer by double clicking and close a layer through the menu (as shown below).

## Controlling Map Views
When a data item or a layer is selected, this layer is called the active layer. One can toggle the **Action** button ![b_action](./imgs/button_action.png) to select and edit an object in the active layer. By toggling the **Zoom** ![b_zoom](./imgs/button_zoom.png) or **Pan** ![b_pan](./imgs/button_pan.png) botton, the map can zoomed in, zoomed out or panned. If one lose in a map, he can use the **Zoom to Full Extent** ![b_zfull](./imgs/button_zoom_full.png) button to get a full view of the map. Other zoom controlling buttons ![b_zlast](./imgs/button_zoom_last.png)![b_znext](./imgs/button_zoom_next.png)![b_zactive](./imgs/button_zoom_active.png)![b_zsel](./imgs/button_zoom_selection.png) can be used to facilitate the map browsing. 

The **Synchronise** ![b_sync](./imgs/button_sync.png) button can be used if you want compare difference between two or more maps. The **Ruler** ![b_ruler](./imgs/button_ruler.png) button can be used to meassure distances. Note that, by default, the unit of the distances measured is **kilometer** under the coordinate system of **Earth**. One can change the coordinate system to **Non-Earth** from the **Settings** Panel of the **Map**, and get **Cartesian** distance without unit.

One can create a 3D surface map by clicking 3D ![b_3d](./imgs/button_3d.png) button, which need a appropriately sized **Grid** (see [3.3](3.3_raster_grids.md#display-settings-and-3d-view)).
