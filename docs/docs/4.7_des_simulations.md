# 4.7 Discrete Event Simulations
MicroCity has a inside simulation time counting and event scheduling mechanism. It provides  several embedded Lua functions to facilitate creating **Discrete Event Simulations**, which is very useful for dynamic system analysis. Sample codes for this chapter can be found in the "simulation_samples" folder of the **Project** Tab in ![icon](./imgs/icon_script_editor.png)**ScriptEditor**.
## Random Number Generation
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "uniform_01")
```
Creates a binary distributed random generation engine from a seed and returns the object.
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "uniform_real" [, min = 0, max = 1])
```
Creates a uniform distributed real random generation engine from a seed and returns the object.
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "uniform_int" [, min = 0, max = 1])
```
Creates an uniform integer random generation engine from a seed and returns the object.
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "triangle" [, a = 0, b = 1, c = 2])
```
Creates a triangle distributed random generation engine from a seed and returns the object. 
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "bernoulli" [, p = 0])
```
Creates a bernoulli distributed random generation engine from a seed and returns the object.
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "cauchy" [, median = 0, sigma = 1])
```
Creates a cauchy distributed random generation engine from a seed and returns the object.
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "exponential" [, lambda = 1])
```
Creates a exponential distributed random generation engine from a seed and returns the object.
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "geometric" [, p = 0])
```
Creates a geometric distributed random generation engine from a seed and returns the object.
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "normal" [, mean = 0, sigma = 1])
```
Creates a normal distributed random generation engine from a seed and returns the object.
```lua
CreateRandEng (seed, "lognormal" [, mean = 0, sigma = 1])
```
Creates a lognormal distributed random generation engine from a seed and returns the object.
```lua
GetNextRandom (Engine)
```
Gets a random number from a random generation engine.
## Simulation Control
```lua
CreateEvent (time, Funcion [, arg1, arg2, ...])
```
Creates a future event from a *Lua Function* or a *Lua Coroutine*. Returns a *Coroutine* object.
```lua
ExecAllEvents ()
```
Calls this at last. It will execute all events as *Lua Coroutines*.
```lua
Delay ([relativeTime = 0])
```
Calls this function in a *Lua Coroutine* will let it first yield then resume it after the specified relative time. If the parameter *relativeTime* is not set, the current *Coroutine* will yield and won' be resumed automatically. 
```lua
Resume ([time, ] Coroutine [, arg1, arg2, ...])
```
Resumes a yielded coroutine immediately or at a specified time.
```lua
GetSimTime ()
```
Returns the current simulation time.
