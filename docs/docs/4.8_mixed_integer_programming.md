# 4.8 Mixed Integer Linear Programming
MicroCity employs the [*lpsolve*](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/) to takle **Mixed Integer Linear Programming** problems. Developers can use embedded Lua functions to build and solve models. Sample codes for this chapter can be found in the "optimization_samples" folder of the **Project** Tab in ![icon](./imgs/icon_script_editor.png)**ScriptEditor**.
## Model Creation and Execution
```lua
CreateLP ([rows = 0 , columns = 0])
```
Creates a *Mixed Integer Linear Programming* model and returns the **LPModel** object.
```lua
SetObjFunction (LPModel, rowTable, "MAX"|"MIN")
```
Sets the objective function of a *LPModel* with a *Lua Table* which stores coefficients of the decision variables.
```lua
AddConstraint (LPModel, rowTable, "<="|">="|"==", rhsValue)
```
Adds a constraint to a *LPModel* with a *Lua Table* which stores coefficients of the decision variables.
```lua
SetInteger (LPModel, index)
```
Sets a decision variable specified by the *index* as an integer variable.
```lua
SetBinary (LPModel, index)
```
Sets a decision variable of a *LPModel* specified by the *index* as a binary variable.
```lua
SetUnbounded (LPModel, index)
```
Sets a decision variable of a *LPModel* to be unbounded(+/- infinity).
```lua
SolveLP (LPModel [, timeoutSec = 60])
```
Solves a *LPModel* and returns 0 as success, -1 as invalid LP model, -2 as nomemory, 1 as suboptimal, 2 as infeasible, 3 as unbounded, 4 as degenerate, 5 as a numerical failure encountered, 6 as the user abort, 7 as a timeout error, 9 as the model could be solved by presolve, 10 as the B&B routine failed, 11 as the B&B was stopped because of a break-at-first, 12 as a feasible B&B solution was found, 13 as no feasible B&B solution found. 
```lua
GetObjective (LPModel)
```
Returns the objective function value of a *LPModel*.
```lua
GetVariable (LPModel, index)
```
Returns the value of a decision variable specified by the *index*.
```lua
GetVariables (LPModel)
```
Returns all values of the decision variables of a *LPModel*.
```lua
GetDual (LPModel, index)
```
Returns the dual value of a decision variable specified by the *index*.
```lua
GetDuals (LPModel)
```
Returns all dual values of the decision variables of a *LPModel*.
```lua
ReadLP("fileName.mps")
```
Reads a *LPModel* from a file (\*.lp, \*.mps) and returns the *LPModel* if succeed.
```lua
WriteLP (LPModel, "fileName.mps")
```
Writes a *LPModel* to a file (\*.lp, \*.mps) and returns true if succeed.
