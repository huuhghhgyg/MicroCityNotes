# 4.5 3D Scenes
**Scenes** and inside **3D objects** ([3.4](3.4_3d_scenes.md)) can be scripted. Sample codes for this chapter can be found in the "3d_samples" folder of the **Project** Tab in ![icon](./imgs/icon_script_editor.png)**ScriptEditor**.
## 3D Scene and Object Manipulation
```lua 
CreateScene ("Title" [, RotSpeed=1] [, TransSpeed=1])
```
Creates a new 3d scene and returns the object.
```lua
AddZipTo3DPath (Scene, "filename.zip")
```
Adds a zip file to the search directory and returns true if succeed. It is useful for collecting a large amount of files.
```lua
LoadSkybox (Scene, "top.jpg" ,"bottom.jpg" ,"left.jpg" ,"right.jpg" ,"front.jpg" ,"back.jpg")
```
Loads six image files as the skybox of a 3d scene.
```lua
LoadObject (Scene, "filename.3ds" [,shadow = false [, AnimationSpeed]])
```
Loads a 3d object from a file and returns the object.
```lua
AddLight (Scene, x, y, z, Radius [, r = 255, g = 255, b = 255])
```
Adds a light object and returns the object.
```lua
Add3DLabel(Scene, "label" [, width=10, height=10 [, r = 180, g = 180, b = 180 [, "font.xml"]]])
```
Adds a 3D label at (0,0,0) and returns the object.
```lua
Add3DLine (Scene, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 [, r = 0, g = 0, b = 0])
```
Adds a 3D line object frome (x1, y1, z1) to (x2, y2, z2) and retruns the object.
```lua
Add3DRect (Scene, length, width [, r = 180, g = 180, b = 180])
```
Adds a 3D rectangular object from (-length/2,0,-width/2) to (length/2,0,width/2) and returns the object.
```lua
Add3DBox (Scene, length, width, height [, r = 180, g = 180, b = 180 [, bShowEdge = true]])
```
Adds a 3D box object from (-length/2,-height/2,-width/2) to (length/2,height/2,width/2) and returns the object.
```lua
AddSphere (Scene, radius [, polycount = 16 [, r = 180, g = 180, b = 180]])
```
Adds a sphere at (0,0,0) and returns the object. If the radius parameter is less than 0, returns an invisible object.
```lua
GetTexture (Object)
```
Returns the texture files of a object: "filename1", "filename2", ... .
```lua
LoadTexture (Scene, Object, "filename1" [, "filename2", ...])
```
Loads texture files to an object.
```lua
SetPosition (Object, x, y, z [, absolute = false])
```
Sets the position of an object relative to its parent (or the absolute position to the scene).
```lua
GetPosition (Object [, absolute = false])
```
Gets the position of an object relative to its parent (or the absolute position to the scene).
```lua
SetRotation (Object, rx, ry, rz [, absolute = false])
```
Sets the rotation (left hand rule) of an object in degrees relative to its parent (or the absolute rotation to the scene).
```lua
GetRotation (Object [, absolute = false])
```
Gets the rotation (left hand rule) of an object in degrees relative to its parent (or the absolute rotation to the scene).
```lua
SetScale (Object, sx, sy, sz)
```
Sets the scale of an object.
```lua
GetScale (Object)
```
Gets the scale of an object.
```lua
SetParent (Object, Parent)
```
Attaches an object to another object as a child.
```lua
GetParent (Object)
```
Gets the parent of an object.
```lua
SetObject (Object "id" [,x, y, z, [,rx, ry, rz [,sx, sy, sz]]])
```
Sets the ID, position, rotation and scale of an object.
```lua
DelObject (Object)
```
Deletes an object.
```lua
SetCamera (Scene, x, y, z [,Tx, Ty, Tz])
```
Sets the position and target of the scene camera.
```lua
GetCamera (Scene)
```
Gets the camera object of a 3d scene and its position and targt.
```lua
GetSelections (Scene)
```
Returns selected objects from a 3d scene.
```lua
GetObjectID (Object1 [, Object2, ...])
```
Returns "id"s of objects.
```lua
SetObjectID (Object, "id")
```
Sets the id of an object.
```lua
GetObject (Scene, "id")
```
Finds an object by its id.
