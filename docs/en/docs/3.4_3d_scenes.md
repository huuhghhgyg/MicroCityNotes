# 3.4 3D Scenes
MicroCity 3D Scene (\*.m3d) is a data file format to store 3D scenes' information. Popular 3D file formats including 3D Studio Max (\*.3ds), Wavefront OBJ (\*.obj) and Stereolithography (\*.stl) can be **loaded** as objects in a scene ([see below](#showing-and-editing-3d-scenes)) but not be stored in the .m3d file.
## Opening, Creating, Saving and Closing 3D Scenes
Users can click **Load** button ![button](../../images/doc/button_load.png) or **File->Scene->Load** menu item to open a **Scene**. Creating new **Scene** can be done from menu **File->Scene->New** and fill the pop-up dialog as shown below. After pressing **Okay** button an item will appear in the **Data** Tab of the **Workspace** Panel. Then **Scene** can be **saved** or **closed** through right-click menu:

![new scene](../../images/doc/new_scene.png) &nbsp;&nbsp; ![scene_menu](../../images/doc/scene_menu.png)
## Showing and Editing 3D Scenes
Double click a **Scene** from the **Data** tab will give you a **scene view**. **Left-mouse-dragging** in a scene veiw will rotate the camera and **right-mouse-dragging** will translate the camera. **Double-left-clicking** a scene view can select objects and **Double-right-clicking** a scene view can popup a context menu (shown below). One can add objects, load objects and set objects, etc.. Note that the **Rotation** in the coordinate system should obey **Left-hand** rule. The illustration of the coordinate system and an example of the rotation around y-axis is shown below:

![object_menu](../../images/doc/object_menu.png) &nbsp;&nbsp; ![scene_coordinate](../../images/doc/scene_coordinate.png)

The coordinate used in the position and rotation of an object is **relative** to its parent object. By default, the parent of a new object is null. 
## Display Settings
Users can change the background color, reference grid or other display options of a **Scene** by using **Settings** Panel.
