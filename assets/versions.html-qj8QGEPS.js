MicroCityWeb does not require any installation, just access its website using a modern browser such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Although running in a browser may cause some performance loss compared to the desktop version, it allows users to use the software on almost any operating system, such as Windows, MacOS, Linux for computers, and Android for mobile devices and tablets.</p><p>Although MicroCityWeb has been developed by the creators of MicroCity, you can still continue to use the previously developed desktop version of MicroCity. However, the desktop version will no longer receive updates for new features. All new features and improvements will be focused on the MicroCityWeb version. This decision aims to ensure that MicroCity can focus on one version and provide the best possible experience in that version. It also makes it easier to manage and maintain MicroCity, avoiding version control issues.</p><p>It should be noted that although the desktop version will no longer receive updates for new features, it can still be used. If users are already accustomed to using the desktop version, they can continue to do so. However, if users want to experience the latest features and improvements, they will need to switch to the MicroCityWeb version.</p><p>The MicroCityWeb version also provides an offline version packaged for browsers (see link above üîó<a href="#microcityweb">link</a>).</p><div class="hint-container warning"><p class="hint-container-title">Note</p><p>However, due to updates to the Chromium browser engine, certain outdated system versions may not be supported (such as Windows versions 8.1 and below, 32-bit Windows operating systems, etc.).</p></div><h2 id="compatibility" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compatibility" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Compatibility</h2><p>Due to the use of experimental JavaScript functions, MicroCityWeb may have compatibility issues running on the following browser engines:</p><ul><li>Most browsers on iOS and iPadOS (due to Apple&#39;s requirement to use Safari&#39;s browser engine)</li><li>Firefox browser</li></ul><p><strong>Compatibility issues and some technical details encountered during testing on 29th September 2023</strong></p><ul><li>iOS and iPadOS: <ul><li>Unable to open local files (due to the use of <code>showOpenFilePicker()</code> method)</li></ul></li><li>Firefox: <ul><li>Unable to open local files (due to the use of <code>showOpenFilePicker()</code> method)</li></ul></li></ul>',10),v=e("code",null,"showOpenFilePicker()",-1),k={href:"https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/window/showOpenFilePicker#%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8%E5%85%BC%E5%AE%B9%E6%80%A7",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},C=e("h2",{id:"summary",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#summary","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" Summary")],-1),M=e("p",null,"The launch of MicroCityWeb version makes the software more user-friendly and popular, benefiting a wider range of users.
