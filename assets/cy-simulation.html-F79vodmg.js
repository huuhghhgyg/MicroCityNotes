In addition, if the object&#39;s properties are well considered, multiple objects can be easily created in the same scene to simulate multiple yard cranes operating in the yard.</p><h4 id="events-and-tasks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#events-and-tasks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Events and Tasks</h4><p>I plan to create <strong>task sequences</strong> for the main entity objects that require movement in the overall process. This allows for parallel operations of multiple yard cranes in the same scene, with each yard crane performing its own tasks without interfering with each other. In addition, a central control program is needed to control the execution of tasks at each time node and the 3D animation of the yard crane.</p><h4 id="business-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#business-process" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Business Process</h4><p>In this simulation, the main focus of the business process is the movement of containers. Therefore, the most important aspect is the transfer of ownership of containers. The process flow of container ownership transfer is shown in the following diagram:</p><div style="text-align:center;"><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="Container Object Process Flow" width="600"></p><p>Container Object Process Flow</p></div><h3 id="object-structure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#object-structure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Object Structure</h3><p>The following are the structures of the main objects involved in this simulation.</p><div style="text-align:center;"><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="Structure of Yard Crane Object" width="500"></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="Structure of Yard Object" width="500"></p></div><h3 id="implementation-approach" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#implementation-approach" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Implementation Approach</h3><h4 id="yard-size" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#yard-size" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Yard Size</h4><p>For the yard object, since its main function is to store container objects and related data (such as coordinates of corresponding positions), we need to determine the size of the yard. Therefore, determining the size of the yard is a necessary step. When creating the yard object, we need to determine the size of the yard, including the number of rows, columns, and height. This facilitates subsequent operations.</p><p>My approach is to first determine the <strong>area occupied by the yard</strong> and the <strong>number of container layers</strong>. Based on the relevant data, we can calculate the maximum number of rows and columns that can be used to place containers.</p><ul><li>Regarding <strong>the area occupied by the yard</strong>, it can be determined by inputting the coordinates of two points when creating the object.

During each loop of task execution, we take out the first task from the object&#39;s task sequence and execute it. After execution, we check if the task completion condition is met. If so, we delete the task and move on to the next one. This ensures that the yard crane objects execute tasks in order during each loop of task execution.</p><p>The method for executing tasks is <code>executeTask(dt)</code>, where the object executes tasks based on the duration <code>dt</code>. The <code>executeTask(dt)</code> function contains the logic for processing tasks, including task type determination, task execution, and task deletion.</p><p>If there are multiple yard cranes in the scene, simply add these objects to the list of objects executing tasks.

Therefore, it is not strictly simultaneous execution here, but sequential execution according to the task sequence at the same time.</p><h4 id="business-process-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#business-process-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Business Process</h4><ol><li>The yard crane first obtains the coordinates of the corresponding position (row, column, height) of the container from the yard and moves the spreader to the designated position in the yard to grab the container.

First, the arrival of AGVs is random, which may cause queuing. Second, the arrival of AGVs triggers the flows of the yard crane and AGV, which in turn trigger the flow of the quay crane. Therefore, the flow of this simulation is a multi-level flow that needs to consider the coordination between multiple objects.</p><p>Especially in the process between AGV and RMG, there is a mutual waiting between AGV and RMG. When the AGV arrives, it needs to notify the RMG to extract the cargo. In the process of extraction by the RMG:</p><ul><li>The RMG needs to wait for the AGV to arrive at the designated position before it can move the cargo onto the AGV.</li><li>The AGV needs to wait for the RMG to grab the container and place it on the AGV before transferring the ownership of the container from the RMG to the AGV.</li></ul><p>Therefore, the process between the AGV and the RMG is a mutually waiting process.
