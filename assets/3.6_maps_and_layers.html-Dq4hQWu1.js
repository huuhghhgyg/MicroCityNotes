Creating a <strong>Map</strong> is by double clicking a <strong>Shapes</strong> or <strong>Grid</strong> from the <strong>Data</strong> Tab of the <strong>Workspace</strong> Panel. A <strong>Map</strong> window contains four coordinate bars which can be used to locate objects (see below). A <strong>Map</strong> can also be printed or closed from the context menu of the <strong>Maps</strong> Tab of the <strong>Workspace</strong> Panel.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="map_coordinates">   <img src="'+s+'" alt="map_menu"></p><h2 id="adding-moving-hiding-and-closing-layers-in-a-map" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-moving-hiding-and-closing-layers-in-a-map"><span>Adding, Moving, Hiding and Closing Layers in a Map</span></a></h2><p>A <strong>Map</strong> can have multiple <strong>Layers</strong>, each of them represents a data item. One can add a <strong>Layer</strong> to a <strong>Map</strong> by double clicking a <strong>Shapes</strong> or a <strong>Grid</strong> from the <strong>Data</strong> Tab.
